MATHEMATICAL FORMULA EXPLANATION:
==================================

Risk Score = Sum of 10 weighted factors (0-100 scale)

Each factor contributes points:
- Age:              0-10 points
- Income:           0-25 points
- CIBIL Rating:     0-40 points
- DTI Ratio:        0-25 points
- Employment:       0-15 points
- Late Payments:    0-35 points
- Accounts:         0-12 points
- Savings Buffer:   0-10 points
- Loan-to-Value:    0-20 points
- Interest Rate:    0-8 points

TOTAL MAX: 100 points (but capped at 100)

INTERPRETATION:
- Lower score = Lower risk = Better credit profile = Better loan terms
- Higher score = Higher risk = Worse credit profile = Difficulty getting loans

RBI GUIDELINES INCORPORATED:
- Minimum income: ₹150,000/year
- DTI Ratio: Should be <50% (as per RBI)
- CIBIL Thresholds: 600-900 (standard in India)
- Employment stability: Valued (lower risk with longer tenure)
- Payment history: Critical factor (late payments heavily penalized)
